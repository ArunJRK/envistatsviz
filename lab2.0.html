    <strong>Degradation</strong><br>
    Land degradation is the temporary or permanent lowering of the productive capacity of land.
    Desertification is the continuous degradation of land under the influence
    of natural and anthropological causes in arid,
    semi-arid and dry-sub humid conditions. Desertification affects
    two third countries of the world and one third of the earth’s
    surface, on which one billion people live (one sixth of world’s population).
    <img src="Images/dryland.jpg" style="display:relative; float:right; margin:40px -100px 30px 30px">
   <br><br> The main causes of land degradation are - Deforestation, overgrazing leading to a reduced growth of vegetation, reduced diversity of plant species, excessive growth of unwanted plant species, soil erosion, and degradation of land due to cattle movement, excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides, Industrialization, and Urbanization.
   <br><br>
    <blockquote>25 per cent of India’s land area is undergoing desertification.</blockquote><br>
<!--     <span class="firstcharacter"></span> -->
    Of the 30
    states, 26 recorded an increase in the area under desertification between 2003-05 and 2011-13


    The status of land degradation and desertification in India has been assessed by several organizations, providing a
    range of disparate estimates. As per a 2016 study carried out by Space Applications Centre, India has a total
    geographic area (TGA) of 328.72 million ha, out of which the total area undergoing the process of land degradation
    is estimated at 96.4 million hectares, which constitutes 29.32 percentage of India’s total land area.
    <br><br>
    <blockquote>
       India lost 48.8 billion USD or 2.5% in FY14 due to Land Degradation
  </blockquote>The effects include
  decreased food security, exacerbated environmental degradation, enhanced migration and slowed poverty reduction.

    <h3>Tamil Nadu</h3>
    Location
    Tamil Nadu is situated between 8°05 ¢ to 13°34 ¢ N latitudes and 76°14 ¢ to

    80°21¢ E longitudes. It covers 13.0 M ha. It is bounded by Karnataka in the north-
    Degraded and Wastelands Status in Different areas • 129




    west, Andhra Pradesh in the north, Puducherry and Bay of Bengal in the east, Indian Ocean in the south and Kerala in
    the west and south-west.
    <h3>Physiography</h3>
    The state has been divided into Deccan plateau, Hill ranges and Coastal plains. These are further subdivided into
    ten landforms: South Deccan plateau, Eastern Ghats (South), Tamil Nadu uplands, Nilgiris, South Sahyadri, Marine
    landform, Riverine landform, Laterite landform, Inland plains, and Kerala plains.

    The South Deccan plateau covers about 130 km2 in the north-western corner of Dharmapuri district. The Eastern Ghats
    (South) are dissected into isolated hill ranges, running generally north-east-south-west through the northern parts
    of North Arcot, Ambedkar, Dharmapuri and Periyar. Elevation ranges from 1,100 to 1,600 m above msl. This landform
    includes Bargur, Kolli, Kalrayan, Shervaroy and Javadi hills.
    <h3>Geology</h3>
    Strategraphic succession of rocks occurring in Tamil Nadu shows the Archaean group as the oldest followed by
    Mesozoic, Tertiary and Quaternary formations. The Archaean group includes gneisses, charnockites, khondalites and
    schists. The Mesozoic rocks of Tamil Nadu occur in isolated patches along the eastern coast. The Miocene rocks are
    (tertiary group) closely associated and are continuous with the Cretaceous rocks of the state. The Pleistocene and
    recent formations (Quartery group) are laterites and alluvium of marine and riverine origin.
    <h3>Climate</h3>
    It is semi-arid tropical monsoonic with an annual rainfall ranging from 550 mm in the plains to 2,400 mm in the
    hills. Rainfall is received in three distinct seasons—namely south-west monsoon (June to September), north-east
    monsoon (October to December), and summer and hot weather season (April to May). Major portion of the rainfall is
    received during the north-east monsoon. Climatic data have shown that potential evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall
    in most of the areas excepting Nilgiris and Kodaikanal.
    <h3>Natural Vegetation</h3>
    The vegetation of the state comprises tropical wet evergreen and semi- evergreen (50%), tropical moist deciduous
    (33%) and tropical dry deciduous (2%) forests, grasslands (2%) and forest plantations (13%).
    The tropical evergreen forests consist of black dammar (Canarium strictum),
    locally known as kunthirikkam; ironwood tree (Mesua ferrea) or churuli; gurjun tree (Dipterocarpus indicus) or vella
    ayani; poonspar tree (Calophylloum elatum) or kattu punna; wild durian (Cullenia excels) or vedipla; Indian
    guttarpercha tree (Palaquium ellipticum) or pali; white dammar or Indian copal tree (Vateria indica) or payini. Many
    species of bamboo are also found.
    Moist deciduous types consist of teak (Tectona grandis), sain tree (Terminalia tomentosa) or kari-marudu; kindal
    tree (Terminalia paniculata) or vellamarudu; Indian rosewood (Dalbergia latifolia) or weeti; white teak
    (Lagerstroemia lanceolata) or venthekku ;pyinkado tree (Xylia xylocarpa) or irul, and Malabar kino tree (Pterocarpus
    marsupium) or venga.
    Soils
    The soils are classified into 6 orders (Entisols, Inceptisols, Alfisols, Mollisols, Ultisols and Vertisols), 12
    suborders, 20 great groups, 44 subgroups and 94 soil families. Of the total area of the state, about 50% is covered
    by Inceptisols, 30% by Alfisols, 7% by Vertisols, 6% by Entisols, 1% by Ultisols, and negligible area by Mollisols
  
    <h3>Land Use</h3>
    Hilly areas have major portion under forests and natural vegetation cover, and the plains are intensively
    cultivated. Natural vegetation consists of evergreen, dry deciduous and shrub types. Cultivable lands account for
    about and forests about 16% of the TGA. Paddy is grown in large areas, followed by groundnut, sugarcane, cotton, pulses
    and other crops.
    Degraded and Wastelands
    Degraded and wastelands area of the state totals to 2,997 thousand ha, which is about 23% of TGA. The worst affected
    districts are Coimbatore (602 thousand ha), Dindigul (258 thousand ha), Viluppuram (228 thousand ha), Chidambaranar
    (179 thousand ha), Kamarajar (173 thousand ha), Teni (171 thousand ha) and Periyar (158 thousand ha) (Fig. 39; Table
    40).

    Water erosion, major causative factor for land degradation, has affected 2,134 thousand ha (about 16% of TGA);
    Coimbatore is worst affected with an area of 472 thousand ha.
    Acidic soils cover 427 thousand ha (4% of TGA), and districts affected in order are Coimbatore (126 thousand ha),
    followed by Dindigul (107 thousand ha), Nilgiris (97 thousand ha) and Teni (58 thousand ha).
    Sodic soils occupy an area of 352 thousand ha (3% of TGA) with highest area in Viluppuram (194 thousand ha),
    followed by Triunelveli (40 thousand ha), Chengalpattu (22 thousand ha) and Chidambaranar (21 thousand ha). Saline
    soils are found in Chidambaranar (7 thousand ha) and Nagappattinam (6 thousand ha).

  <div class="content" style="padding: 100px 0">
    There has been
    an increase of 1.87mha undergoing land degradation/desertification between 2011-13 and 2003-05. During this period
    1.95mha has been reclaimed and 0.44 mha converted from high severity to low severity. At the same time, 3.63 mha of
    productive land has degraded and 0.74 mha has shifted from low to high severity degradation status. During this
    period, the states showing increases in degradation are Delhi, Tripura, Nagaland, Himachal Pradesh and Mizoram
    (11.03-4.34%) whereas Odisha, Rajasthan, Telengana, and Uttar Pradesh have improved their degradation status (-0.11
    to -1.27%).</div>
