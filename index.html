    <strong>Degradation</strong><br>
    Land degradation is the temporary or permanent lowering of the productive capacity of land.
    Desertification is the continuous degradation of land under the influence
    of natural and anthropological causes in arid,
    semi-arid and dry-sub humid conditions. Desertification affects
    two third countries of the world and one third of the earth’s
    surface, on which one billion people live (one sixth of world’s population).
    <!-- <img src="Images/dryland.jpg" style="display:relative; float:right; margin:40px -100px 30px 30px"> -->
   <br><br> The main causes of land degradation are - Deforestation, overgrazing leading to a reduced growth of vegetation, reduced diversity of plant species, excessive growth of unwanted plant species, soil erosion, and degradation of land due to cattle movement, excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides, Industrialization, and Urbanization.
   <br><br>
    <blockquote>29.32 per cent of India’s land area is undergoing desertification.</blockquote><br>
<!--     <span class="firstcharacter"></span> -->
    Of the 30
    states, 26 recorded an increase in the area under desertification between 2003-05 and 2011-13. The land degradation is studied by several oraganisations and their definition of the degradation vary. As per a 2016 study carried out by Space Applications Centre, India has a total geographic area (TGA) of 328.72 million ha, out of which the total area undergoing the process of land degradation is estimated at 96.4 million hectares, which constitutes 29.32 percentage of India’s total land area.

    <blockquote>
       India lost 48.8 billion USD or 2.5% in FY14 due to Land Degradation
  </blockquote>The effects include
  decreased food security, exacerbated environmental degradation, enhanced migration and slowed poverty reduction.

    <blockquote>There has been an increase of 1.87 mha undergoing land degradation between 2011-13 and 2003-05.</blockquote> During this period
    1.95mha has been reclaimed and 0.44 mha converted from high severity to low severity. At the same time, 3.63 mha of
    productive land has degraded and 0.74 mha has shifted from low to high severity degradation status. During this
    period, the states showing increases in degradation are Delhi, Tripura, Nagaland, Himachal Pradesh and Mizoram
    (11.03-4.34%) whereas Odisha, Rajasthan, Telengana, and Uttar Pradesh have improved their degradation status (-0.11
    to -1.27%).
